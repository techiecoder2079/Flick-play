                Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, 
                stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, 
                when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted 
                player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him
                 an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being
                  offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if 
                  he can accomplish the impossible, inception. But no amount of careful 
                  planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict 
                  their every move....
